            <p>The hardy and sweet-tempered Samoyed was originally used to hunt, herd reindeer, and haul sledges for the Siberian Samoyede people. 
            His white, fluffy coat is beautiful, but requires rigorous grooming. His reputation as an intelligent family dog is well deserved. 
            He is happiest when he is part of family life, and needs to be with people.
